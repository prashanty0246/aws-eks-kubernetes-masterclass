# Create EKS Cluster & Node Groups

## Step-00: Introduction
- Understand about EKS Core Objects
  - Control Plane
      -  eks runs a single tenant k8s control plane for each cluster, and control palne infra is not shared across clusters or aws accounts
      -  this control plab consists of at least 2 api-server nodes and three etcd nodes that run across three az within a region
      -  eks automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, restarting them across the az within the region as needed.
  - Worker Nodes & Node Groups
    - worker machines in k8s are called nodes. these are ec2 instances.
    - eks worker nodes run in our aws account and connect to our cluster's control plane via cluster api-server endpoint
    - a node group is one or more ec2 instances thar are deployed in an ec2 autoscaling group.
    - All instances in a Node-group must
        - be the same instance type.
        - be running the same AMI
        - use the same EKS worker node IAM role.

  - Fargate Profiles
    - aws fargate is a technology that provides on-demand, right-sized compute capacity for containers.
    - with fargate, we no longer have to provision, configure, or scale groups of virtual machines ot run containers
    - each pod running on Fargate has its own isolation boundary and does not share the underlying kernel, cpu reources, memroy resources or elastic network interface with another pod.
    - aws specially build Fargate controllers that recognizes the pods belonging to Fargate and schedules them on fargate profiles.
    - 
  - VPC
     - eks uses AWS VPC network policies to restrict traffic between control plane components to within a single cluser
     - control Plane components for eks cluster cannot view or receive communication from other clusters or other aws accounts, except as autherized with k8s RBAC policies.
     - this secure and highly avaialable configiuration makes EKS reliable and recommended for production workloads.
- Create EKS Cluster
- Associate EKS Cluster to IAM OIDC Provider
- Create EKS Node Groups
- Verify Cluster, Node Groups, EC2 Instances, IAM Policies and Node Groups


## Step-01: Create EKS Cluster using eksctl
- It will take 15 to 20 minutes to create the Cluster Control Plane 
```
# Create Cluster
eksctl create cluster --name=eksdemo1 \
                      --region=us-east-1 \
                      --zones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b \
                      --without-nodegroup 

# Get List of clusters
eksctl get cluster                  
```


## Step-02: Create & Associate IAM OIDC Provider for our EKS Cluster
- To enable and use AWS IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts on our EKS cluster, we must create &  associate OIDC identity provider.
- To do so using `eksctl` we can use the  below command. 
- Use latest eksctl version (as on today the latest version is `0.21.0`)
```                   
# Template
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
    --region region-code \
    --cluster <cluter-name> \
    --approve

# Replace with region & cluster name
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --cluster eksdemo1 \
    --approve
```



## Step-03: Create EC2 Keypair
- Create a new EC2 Keypair with name as `kube-demo`
- This keypair we will use it when creating the EKS NodeGroup.
- This will help us to login to the EKS Worker Nodes using Terminal.

## Step-04: Create Node Group with additional Add-Ons in Public Subnets
- These add-ons will create the respective IAM policies for us automatically within our Node Group role.
 ```
# Create Public Node Group   
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=eksdemo1 \
                        --region=us-east-1 \
                        --name=eksdemo1-ng-public1 \
                        --node-type=t3.medium \
                        --nodes=2 \
                        --nodes-min=2 \
                        --nodes-max=4 \
                        --node-volume-size=20 \
                        --ssh-access \
                        --ssh-public-key=kube-demo \
                        --managed \
                        --asg-access \
                        --external-dns-access \
                        --full-ecr-access \
                        --appmesh-access \
                        --alb-ingress-access 
```

## Step-05: Verify Cluster & Nodes

### Verify NodeGroup subnets to confirm EC2 Instances are in Public Subnet
- Verify the node group subnet to ensure it created in public subnets
  - Go to Services -> EKS -> eksdemo -> eksdemo1-ng1-public
  - Click on Associated subnet in **Details** tab
  - Click on **Route Table** Tab.
  - We should see that internet route via Internet Gateway (0.0.0.0/0 -> igw-xxxxxxxx)

### Verify Cluster, NodeGroup in EKS Management Console
- Go to Services -> Elastic Kubernetes Service -> eksdemo1

### List Worker Nodes
```
# List EKS clusters
eksctl get cluster

# List NodeGroups in a cluster
eksctl get nodegroup --cluster=<clusterName>

# List Nodes in current kubernetes cluster
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Our kubectl context should be automatically changed to new cluster
kubectl config view --minify
```

### Verify Worker Node IAM Role and list of Policies
- Go to Services -> EC2 -> Worker Nodes
- Click on **IAM Role associated to EC2 Worker Nodes**

### Verify Security Group Associated to Worker Nodes
- Go to Services -> EC2 -> Worker Nodes
- Click on **Security Group** associated to EC2 Instance which contains `remote` in the name.

### Verify CloudFormation Stacks
- Verify Control Plane Stack & Events
- Verify NodeGroup Stack & Events

### Login to Worker Node using Keypai kube-demo
- Login to worker node
```
# For MAC or Linux or Windows10
ssh -i kube-demo.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP-of-Worker-Node>

# For Windows 7
Use putty
```

## Step-06: Update Worker Nodes Security Group to allow all traffic
- We need to allow `All Traffic` on worker node security group
